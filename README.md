# Predictive-Analytics-in-Healthcare-Mangement
This repository showcases the "Predictive Analytics in Healthcare Management" project, a data-driven analysis initiative aimed at enhancing cost management for a Health Management Organization (HMO). Developed a predictive model leveraging real-world data to identify key cost drivers in healthcare and forecast potential high-cost patients.

What's Inside:

Comprehensive Data Analysis: A thorough exploration of healthcare factors influencing costs, such as patient demographics, lifestyle habits, and medical history.
Robust Predictive Models: Application of various statistical and machine learning techniques, including Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree algorithms, to predict healthcare costs.
Interactive Shiny Application: A user-friendly web app deployed to visualize predictions and validate the model's effectiveness against real outcomes.
Geospatial Insights: Visualization of healthcare cost distributions across different geographic locations, providing strategic insights into regional cost management.
Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Detailed documentation of data cleaning steps, ensuring high-quality and reliable inputs for model training.
SQL Scripts and Database Management: SQL code for database creation, including table structures, constraints, and associations ensuring data integrity and efficiency.
The repository serves as an end-to-end solution for HMOs looking to harness the power of data to make informed decisions. With our actionable insights and model predictions, healthcare providers can tailor their services to minimize costs while maintaining quality care.

Key Achievements:

Successfully identified high-cost individuals with over 87% accuracy using Support Vector Machine.
Achieved significant predictive performance with a Decision Tree model, marked by a sensitivity of over 97%.
Developed an intuitive Shiny app for dynamic cost prediction and analysis, enhancing stakeholder engagement.
Usage:

This project is tailored for healthcare analysts, data scientists, and policy makers interested in utilizing predictive analytics for cost optimization. By following the detailed guides and utilizing the provided code, users can replicate our approach, adapt the models to their datasets, or extend the analysis further.
